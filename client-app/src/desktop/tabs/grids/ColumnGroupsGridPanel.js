                <p>
                    Hoist React grids support column grouping as described in the ag-grid
                    <a href="https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-column-properties/#columns-and-column-groups" target="_blank">
                    documentation</a> with a few important wrinkles. Column groups must be explicitly define with either
                    a unique headerName or groupId. Also column groups in Hoist React are 'sealed'. This means that
                    columns maybe reordered within the group in which they are defined but not broken out of them.
                </p>,
                <p>
                    This grid also demonstrates persistent grid state using the browser's local storage.
