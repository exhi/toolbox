                    Hoist's Grid supports the display of hierarchical tree data, leveraging the
                    underlying support for nested data rows provided by ag-Grid. The <code>DimensionChooser</code> menu
                    allows control over the tree hierarchy, and stores the user's recent history for quick access.
                    History can also be persisted on the server with <code>XH.prefService()</code>.
                </p>,
                <p>
                    Applications provide standard record data with <code>children</code> nodes containing
                    their sub-records. Data aggregations may be provided to the grid, or computed
                    within the grid via ag-Grid aggregation configs.
