## Welcome to the Hoist Toolbox

Toolbox is an application designed to showcase Hoist, Extremely Heavy's full-stack UI toolkit.

Toolbox consists of both a desktop and mobile app with examples of all Hoist Components, their usage, and links to 
related Hoist and Toolbox source code.  Toolbox also provides several application examples which may be especially 
useful as a starting point for application developers new to the framework.

Please refer to the [Hoist Core](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core) and [Hoist React](https://github.com/xh/hoist-react)
repos for detailed information and documentation on Hoist.

Toolbox is (of course) itself a Hoist Application, and XH will aim to keep it updated with the latest versions of the Hoist
Framework.  In particular, the dev version -- https://toolbox-dev.xh.io -- will be deployed
with CI using the current `develop` branches of Hoist, while the production version -- https://toolbox.xh.io -- will 
typically be re-released with every new released version of Hoist. 

Note that Toolbox uses 'Auth0' as its authentication provider, and includes various client-side and server side adaptors
for that. Typical Hoist applications will use an enterprise-specific Single Sign-On (SSO) such as JESPA/NTLM, kerberos, 
or another OAuth based solution.

üôè Thanks for your patience as we continue to build out this application.  All suggestions are welcome!
